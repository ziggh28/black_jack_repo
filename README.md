*purpose of the game 

  blackjack commmonly know as 21  is a card game,  the rulse to the game are fairly simple 

two cards are dealt to each player. The dealer shows one card face up, and the other is face down.  The player gets to see both of his or her cards and the total of them is added.  Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points, Aces are worth 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.  The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 (“blackjack”) without going over (called “busting.”)

the player goes first, the player as to the value of all of his/her cards and a decision on the 1 card shown by the dealer. the player has two choice to hit or stand.

The dealer must hit if their card total is less than 17, and must stand if it is 17 or higher. 

Whichever player gets closest to 21 without exceeding it, wins.
